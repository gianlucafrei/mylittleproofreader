# My Little Proofreader

My Little Proofreader is leveraging ChatGPT's advanced language understanding capabilities to offer proofreading that surpasses traditional spellcheckers. This tool is adept at not only catching spelling errors but also identifying contextual inaccuracies, providing users with a more comprehensive and intelligent proofreading solution. And it workes for almost any language. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³...

- **Advanced Spellchecking:** Utilizes ChatGPT to detect and correct not just typos but also contextually inappropriate words.
- **Contextual Error Detection:** Identifies and suggests corrections for errors based on the context of the text, something beyond the reach of standard spellcheckers.
- **Right-Click Menu Integration:** Easy to use when writing text in any program
